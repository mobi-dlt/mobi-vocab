        This repository will be versioned at periodic points in time with a Q1

        Version Definitions:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          MAJOR - significant changes rolled forward from the previous major

      As a rule, versioning will follow the specification outlined in the
      <a href="https://semver.org/">Semantic Versioning 2.0</a> spec This
      approach to versioning gives the ability to integrate with and provided
      automated testing and validation against defined types without worry of
      instability or breaking changes being introduced, while also limiting the
      frequency of possibly breaking changes to prevent a large number of
      incompatible versions.

      <h2>Introduction</h2>

      <p>
        This specification describes a Linked Data vocabulary for asserting
        Verifiable Credentials related to traceability information, such as
        chemical properties, mechanical properties, country of origin, and other
        attributes used to determine the status of a products and materials in a
        supply chain.
      </p>

      <p>
        Generally, this vocabulary may be looked at as a set of common objects
        that are shared across multiple business verticals, and vertical or
        use case specific items that apply to one or more specific commodities
        or market segments. A primary goal of this specification is to
        standardize the creation of Verifiable Credentials from standardized
        JSON-LD which is itself created from JSON Schema definitions as would
        normally be passed of REST and other APIs.  This promotes code re-use
        and establishes a pattern for the creation of JSON-LD and related
        Verifiable Credentials derived from those JSON-LD objects in a manner
        that is friendly to code and API development as well as to promote
        better interoperability between vendors who serve common or related
        markets.
      </p>

      <p>
        The <a href="#vocabulary">Vocabulary</a> section covers each vocabulary
        item, its properties, other attributes, and provides and example
        Verifiable Credential for each item.
      </p>

      <p>
        This repository has primary contributors from four main market segments,
        and has subject matter experts from those market segments delegated
        as leads for objects related to vocabulary items for each segment.
        <br />
        These subject matter leads help identify common elements across verticals
        as well as in assessing contributions of new objects to the vocabulary.

        <h3>Use Cases and Requirements</h3>

        <p>
          The following use cases outline a number of key scenarios that readers
          might find useful in a variety of sectors, especially those that deal
          with cross border supply chain data interchange.
        </p>

        <!-- definition styling works well for these, but we can adjust at a later data should we want to break out into another format -->
        <section>
          <h4>Steel and Metals</h4>
          <dl class="termlist">
            <p>
              The global steel industry relies on cross-party communication of
              product and business information to successfully move materials
              from mines, to manufacturers, through customs, to end customers
              (such as automotive and construction companies). Today this
              information exists primarily in siloed paper documents. In the
              current format it is very difficult to make data comparisons
              across a small number of parties, let alone across millions of
              shipments over time. It can also be difficult to catch forged
              documents in the absence of digital signatures and clearly defined
              organization data attributes.
            </p>

            <p>
              A shared vocabulary creates opportunities for steel trading
              partners to work from a common digital representation of trade
              information. Take the example of a mill report for a steel
              product. This document provides important information about the
              chemical make-up of steel materials, helping to ensure the desired
              specification and grade have been met. It also acts as evidence
              about the origins of steel materials. Unambiguous representation
              of mill report fields is critical for assessing appropriate
              duties, meeting customer requirements, and ultimately ensuring
              consumer safely.
            </p>

            <p>
              By defining the schema for each field, importers can now answer
              questions like ‚ÄúHow many pipes of specification XYZ did we
              purchase last year?‚Äù (i.e.,
              <a
                href="https://dlt.mobi/mobility-schmea#schemas/ChemicalProperty.json"
                >ChemicalProperty</a
              >). The mill report can also be linked to other trade
              documentation such as commercial invoices and bills of lading when
              those credentials are specified and defined. Regulators can also
              ask questions across a large number of mill reports to help catch
              transshipment issues, such as ‚ÄúHow much steel product imported
              last month specified Vietnam as the country of origin?‚Äù (i.e.,
              <a href="https://schema.org/addressCountry">addressCountry</a>).

          <p>
            Several use cases exist for common vocabulary in the food and
            agriculture space. Key priorities for this project revolve around
            items that are required for the safe and succesful importation of
            food to various countries.

            flexibility to account for newly defined inspction types as needs
            change in the food and agricultre industry. This object can be
            sub-classed to allow for schema level validation of specific types
            of inspections and audits as required by the specifics of a given
            use case. Verifiable Credentials can be issued for this object or

              A common traceability vocabulary will enable creation of a common
              digital representation of an oil and gas assets and a variety of
              use cases. The main priority of this project is the border
              clearance and regulatory compliance use cases, that enable
              industry players to rely on the asset history, origin, and
              composition recorded as Verifiable credentials to be used in these
              processes.

              The asset-specific CrudeOil VC (and NaturalGas VC) object serves
              as a root object that stores the key attributes of the asset as
              well as origin and composition. In addition to the asset VC, we
              are planning to represent key events in the asset‚Äôs lifecycle
              (inspection, transportation, transfer of ownership) as Verifiable
              Credentials.

            <p>
              A common traceability vocabulary will allow complex supply chains
              that import goods to US-resident customers to register individual
              packages and pre-register products intended for sale to the US
              with US Customs. For the data needs of Customs to be met by highly
              heterogenous supply chains that might require much "internal
              confidentiality" (between supply chain actors), a highly sharded
              data model is required, whereby many different actors can each
              submit data points separately that get combined at time of customs
              processing.
            </p>
            <p>
              Without strong identification of legal entities (i.e., legally
              defined and registered supply chain actors) and of products, and
              without high levels of semantic flexibility, the shards can be
              quite hard to combine usefully. Linking the registration of
              individual packages together with the pre-registration of
              commercial products and actors is the key value-add of this
              system, but could also be a burdensome request on importers,
              retailers, and freight forwarders. To minimize this burden, we are
              aligning wherever possible with the ontology work of GS1 (GTINs
              and vLEIs), and with shipping and tracking semantics already
              adopted today by international logistics consortia. We distinguish
              between the VCs that are issued in relation to a specific package
              and the contextual information that needs to be queried to
              validate package information, as well as to make valuable
              assessments, inferences, and data quality remediation on Customs
              pre-entry data.

            <p>
              NOTE: To facilitate linking and alignment across internal and
              external processes, many of the VCs modeled in this project are
              labeled "process" VCs, meaning they refer to the internal
              processes of a customs agency. Reusability here is likely minimal
              compared to the rest of the vocabulary, but they are included for
              informational purposes and to ensure they stay aligned with any
              changes to the private-sector/logistics-industry data model being
              consumed by those processes. These may also be less documented
              than the product- and package- VCs, which correspond to
              standardized data models in the logistics and shipping sector.

      <h2>Privacy Considerations</h2>

      <p>
        This section details the general privacy considerations and specific
        privacy implications of deploying this specification into production
        environments.

      <h2>Security Considerations</h2>

      <p>
        There are a number of security considerations that implementers should
        be aware of when processing data described by this specification.
        Ignoring or not understanding the implications of this section can
        result in security vulnerabilities.
      </p>

      <p>
        While this section attempts to highlight a broad set of security
        considerations, it is not a complete list. Implementers are urged to
        seek the advice of security and cryptography professionals when
        implementing mission critical systems using the technology outlined in
        this specification.

      <h2>Accessibility Considerations</h2>

      <p>
        There are a number of accessibility considerations implementers should
        be aware of when processing data described in this specification. As
        with any web standards or protocols implementation, ignoring
        accessibility issues makes this information unusable to a large subset
        of the population. It is important to follow accessibility guidelines
        and standards, such as [[WCAG21]], to ensure all people, regardless of
        ability, can make use of this data. This is especially important when
        establishing systems utilizing cryptography, which have historically
        created problems for assistive technologies.

        This section details the general accessibility considerations to take
        into account when utilizing this data model.

      <h2>Internationalization Considerations</h2>

      <p>
        There are a number of internationalization considerations implementers
        should be aware of when publishing data described in this specification.
        As with any web standards or protocols implementation, ignoring
        internationalization makes it difficult for data to be produced and
        consumed across a disparate set of languages and societies, which would
        limit the applicability of the specification and significantly diminish
        its value as a standard.
      </p>

      <p>
        This section outlines general internationalization considerations to
        take into account when utilizing this data model.
